Notes:

Just print everything with 2-3 perimeter layers and 20% infill. Pay attention to the orientation of the 3D parts: none of them need support, but you have to place them correctly on the heated-bed.
You can print everything at once on a regular heated bed. Check the image showing how to place everything as reference.

NOTES
There are two 3D part which will need some burr to be cleaned from the bolts holes:
- LOWER ARM PULLEY SUPPORT
- UPPER ARM
That is perfectly OK. Just remove it and screw the bolts as usual :-)
